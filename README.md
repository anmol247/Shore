## Shore
A minimalist Weather App (for iOS).

## How it Works?
The application uses Weather APIs from a trussted source, OpenWeatherMap, to determine the state of the weather in real time.

## Interface
The app has a minimalistic design with a little to no interactions at all. The app asks for user's permission for accessing the loctaion. If successfull, the app would show the current weather information along with some changed background colour in depending upon the weather conditions. 

## The App
Here are few screenshots to help get a better idea of how the app actually looks:
