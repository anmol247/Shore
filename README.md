## Shore
A minimalist Weather App (for iOS).

## How it Works?
The application uses Weather APIs from a trussted source, OpenWeatherMap, to determine the state of the weather in real time.

## Interface
The app has a minimalistic design with a little to no interactions at all. The app does as it states.

## The App
Here are few screenshots to help get a better idea of how the app actually looks:
